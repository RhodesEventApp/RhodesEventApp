Project Description Questions & Answers 
What is the project that your team will build? Write a 1-3 sentence description of what your project is and what you hope it will be able to do. 
We will build an event promotion app where users can upload flyers advertising their Rhodes events. Users can scroll through their feed of events and like events they are considering attending. Users can add these events to an internal calendar if they wish to go. 

What are the main challenges that you see in building this project? What are the risks?
The main challenges we anticipate when building the project is: 
Figuring out how to code an app (cross platform development using Fluter)
Creating a design for the app (instagram like?)
Working as a team
Some of the risk we have when developing this app is: 
The risk of personal identification being leaked through the profile system, thus leading to identity theft (users only input rhodes email before @, we add the @rhodes.edu part)
Users posting inappropriate or non event related content
Possible leaks from database

Team Members and Contributions 
What is your plan for ensuring that your team agrees that everyone has contributed equally? What consequences will be involved if someone does not contribute equally?
If someone is not doing their share of the work (as determined by a majority vote from the group), they will have to endure public embarrassment in the form of a sign hung from their neck that says “I failed the Senior Sem team contract and let my peers down”. They must stand in front of the Rat during lunch hours on a date chosen by the rest of the group.

Process
When will your team hold meetings? For this semester, you should have at least two weekly 1-2 hour blocks where all team members can attend on a regular basis.
For this semester we plan to meet roughly right after Senior Seminar. This would be Tuesdays and Thursdays around 5 pm. We understand that people might have conflicts, such as sports practices but will work with the members. 
For next semester we will have to meet again and look at everyone’s schedules before we can make a concrete time to meet every week.

Doing the Work
How will the work be divided among team members? 
We want everyone in the team to be excited about what we are making therefore we want to give team members the freedom to choose what they will contribute to the project. This comes with the understanding that if a core element of the project is being looked over, we will work together to ensure we create a cohesive project.
At the meetings when we give out assignments to each member on their parts, we will also make deadlines for the parts of the project to therefore hold each other accountable for the progress being made. 
How will you review each other's work? By what process will you approve or request changes on work?
When we meet during the week, each team member will do a short presentation on what they worked on since the last meeting, as well as any challenges or issues they may have encountered. The meetings will also establish what each member will work on individually until the next meeting.

Decision Making
How will you make progress when you have strong disagreements?
If there is a strong disagreement and people are feeling volatile, we will temporarily shift our focus to other aspects of the project that we are in agreement on, in order to cool down. If, after emotions are settled, there is still disagreement, we will schedule a meeting with a nonpartisan bystander, most likely a professor, who can rule on the dispute.

Every group member agrees with the contents of the document and agrees to uphold the group standards that were agreed upon at the meeting.
